            <div class="description">Cedric Diggory is a fictional character in the Harry Potter series of novels by J. K. Rowling. He is introduced in the third book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, but plays a larger role in the fourth book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. He is a Hufflepuff student and Quidditch player at the wizarding school Hogwarts. After competing in the Triwizard Tournament, he is murdered by Peter Pettigrew on Lord Voldemort's orders.[1]

                Cedric's death becomes a point of trauma and guilt for Harry, who forms the student group Dumbledore's Army to help his fellow students protect themselves. Cedric's demise is also a pivotal plot event in the stage play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Cedric is portrayed by Robert Pattinson in the film adaptation of Goblet of Fire and by Joe Livermore in Prisoner of Azkaban.[2] Blake Ritson provides his voice in the Goblet of Fire video game.[3]</div>
